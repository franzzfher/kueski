## 3. Risk Segment Performance Analysis

| Risk Segment | % of Portfolio | Funded | Loss Rate | Net Margin Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Risk (4-4.2)** | 42.5% | $4,507,586 | 26.2% | -17.3% 🔴 |
| **Medium Risk (3)** | 34.7% | $3,679,063 | 6.4% | -0.7% 🟡 |
| **Very High Risk (5)** | 15.3% | $1,621,890 | 34.4% | -27.3% 🔴 |
| **Low Risk (1-2)** | 7.0% | $737,786 | 0.1% | -5.0% 🟡 |
| **Unknown** | 0.6% | $68,854 | 0.0% | +9.7% 🟢 |

### Key Insights
* **Concentration of Loss:** High Risk (4-4.2) + Very High Risk (5) = **57.7%** of portfolio, but **97%** of losses.
* **The Sweet Spot:** Medium Risk (3) is nearly break-even (-0.7%).
* **Inefficient Low Risk:** Low Risk (1-2) has low loss rates, but CAC is too high relative to revenue generated.

## 4. Yield Gap Analysis
The portfolio suffers from a significant "Yield Gap"—the difference between expected and actual yield rates.

| Risk Segment | Expected Yield | Actual Yield | Yield Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Risk (4.2)** | 22.8% | 13.4% | -9.4% |
| **Very High Risk (5)** | 20.5% | 12.2% | -8.3% |
| **High Risk (4.1)** | 20.7% | 14.0% | -6.7% |
| **Medium Risk (3)** | 15.2% | 11.9% | -3.3% |
| **Low Risk (2)** | 7.8% | 6.5% | -1.3% |

> **Root Cause:** Interest collection rates are significantly below expectations.
> * Overall interest collection: **66.3%** (vs. 100% expected)
> * High Risk (4.2) collection: **58.8%**

## 5. Unit Economics (LTV/CAC)

| Risk Segment | Avg CAC | LTV/CAC | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unknown** | $31.74 | 5.37x | ✅ Good |
| **Very High Risk (5)** | $26.00 | 5.12x | ✅ Good |
| **High Risk (4.2)** | $37.50 | 4.98x | ✅ Good |
| **High Risk (4.1)** | $44.33 | 4.75x | ✅ Good |
| **Medium Risk (3)** | $54.39 | 3.17x | ⚠️ Marginal |
| **Low Risk (2)** | $72.60 | 1.14x | ❌ Poor |
| **Low Risk (1)** | $134.69 | 0.26x | ❌ Poor |

> **The Paradox:** Higher risk segments have **BETTER** LTV/CAC ratios because CAC is lower, but charge-offs destroy profitability. Lower risk segments have poor unit economics due to high CAC relative to loan size.

## 6. Scenario Analysis

**Current State:** Total Portfolio Loss: **-$1,285,834**

### Scenario 1: Remove High/Very High Risk Segments
*If Kueski stops lending to Risk Bands 4.1, 4.2, and 5:*
* **Remaining Portfolio:** $4.5M (42% of current volume)
* **Projected Net Margin:** -$38K (vs current -$1.29M)
* **Improvement:** $1.25M (97% loss reduction)
* **Loss Rate:** Drops from 18.8% to ~3.3%

### Scenario 2: Increase Pricing for High-Risk
*Required interest rate increases to achieve break-even:*
* **High Risk (4.1):** 24.5% → **38.7%** (+14.2 pts)
* **High Risk (4.2):** 28.6% → **62.8%** (+34.2 pts)
* **Very High Risk (5):** 30.1% → **71.8%** (+41.7 pts)
* ⚠️ *These rate increases may not be market-viable or regulatory-compliant.*

## 7. Final Recommendations to CEO/CFO

### Recommendation: Adopt a Hybrid Approach

#### 1. Acquisition Policy Changes
* **IMMEDIATELY suspend lending to Risk Band 5 (Very High Risk).**
    * *Rationale:* -27.3% net margin and 34.4% loss rate.
    * *Potential Savings:* $444K.
* **SIGNIFICANTLY reduce lending to Risk Band 4.2.**
    * *Rationale:* -23.3% net margin and 31.9% loss rate.
    * *Potential Savings:* $572K.
* **MAINTAIN current acquisition for Risk Bands 1-3.**
    * *Rationale:* These segments are near break-even or profitable.

#### 2. Pricing Policy Changes
* **INCREASE rates for Risk Band 4.1 by 5-8 percentage points.**
    * Current: 24.5% → Target: **30-32%**
    * *Rationale:* This is more achievable than the 38.7% break-even rate.
* **MAINTAIN current rates for Risk Bands 1-3.**

#### 3. Operational Improvements
* **FOCUS collections efforts on 0-30 DPD bucket.**
    * Early intervention can prevent roll to later stages.
* **REDUCE CAC for Low Risk segments.**
    * Current CAC of $72-135 is too high for loan sizes.
    * Target: <$50 for Low Risk (1-2).

#### 4. Expected Impact
* **Projected Improvement:** +$800K to +$1M annually
* **Target Portfolio Net Margin:** +5% to +8%
* **Reduced Loss Rate:** From 18.8% to <8%

## Conclusion
The current portfolio is unsustainable with a -12.11% net margin rate. The evidence clearly supports the CFO's position that changes are needed. However, a complete abandonment of high-risk segments may be too aggressive.

A measured approach that **eliminates the worst-performing segment (Risk Band 5)**, **significantly reduces exposure to Risk Band 4.2**, and **increases pricing** for remaining high-risk loans will position KueskiPay for sustainable profitability while maintaining market presence.
